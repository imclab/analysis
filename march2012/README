Analysis of MLab March 2012

Environment Setup
=================

This analysis was originally developed inside an ipython notebook.

Once the module dependencies are installed on your system, the script will
execute correctly outside of an ipython notebook.  However, features such as
graph generation will not be available.

To access these features, configure your environment to support ipython 
notebooks, create a new notebook, and copy the analysis code into the notebook.

Install:

    NOTE: easy_install may automatically pull in some other deps.

    The iPython notebooks used were version 0.13 or greater.
    At the time of writing, the only source of this version was through
    easy_install setup.

    The basic packages are: 
        * mysql-server - for the mysql data dump from Samknows
        * python-mysqldb - for python-to-mysql queries
        * pandas    - a numeric library
        * matplotlib - the main graphing engine used by ipython

    Only if configuring ipython:
        * ipython - for notebooks and easy graphing.

    Some of these packages have additional dependencies.
        $ sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
        $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

    This may pull in all the requirements for ipython and pandas automatically.
        $ sudo easy_install ipython
        $ sudo easy_install pandas        # if not installed as part of ipython

    But, sometimes not all packages are pulled automatically.  Other needed 
    packages for some systems are:
        $ sudo easy_install MySQL-python
        $ sudo easy_install NumPy
        $ sudo easy_install tornado
        $ sudo easy_install pyzmq
        $ sudo easy_install matplotlib
        
    Mac OSX:
        # if the mysql library is 32-bit only...
        # or, if the 32-bit version is installed on a 64-bit system
        PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:${PATH}"
        export PATH
        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mysql/lib/
        export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_64_BIT=no
        export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes

BigQuery:

    Some data is stored in bigquery.  You will need to request access to the
    M-Lab bigquery project.

    Install the bigquery command line tool:
        $ sudo easy_install bigquery

    Then, follow the on-screen directions provided by:
        $ bq init

    Be sure to choose the "measurement-lab   M-Lab" project as default.

    You should now be able to run queries:
        $ bq query "select count(*) from m_lab.2012_08;"

Import SQL:

    # example given for expediency not security.
    $ sudo mysqladmin -uroot -p create march2012

    # raw.sql is the raw samknows db dump.
    $ sudo mysql -uroot -p march2012 < raw.sql 

    # to grant access to db from your current user:
    $ mysql -uroot 
    mysql> grant all on march2012.* to ''@localhost;

    ## NOTE: you can rename an existing DB by migrating all tables 
    ## from the old name to a new name.
        RENAME TABLE samknows.unit_location     TO march2012.unit_location;

Start notebook:

    $ ipython notebook --pylab inline

    This should open a web browser with a list of notebooks in the CWD. Click
    on one and it should open like a document.  Without the extra args above,
    graphs will not load in-line.
