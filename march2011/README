ABOUT THE FILES:
1. httpgetmt.commented.sql: This is a commented version of the sql 
file that the FCC used to do their analysis. Only the interesting
parts of the file are commented (defining and filling the temporary
tables and calculating peak usage). The original came from ....
2. speed.sql.sh: A shell script to generate sql that can be used
with bq to generate results for sustained speeds during 24-hour and 
peak periods. 
3. tables.md: A description of the tables contained in the dataset 
and the mechanics of the FCC's analysis of the data contained 
therein.
4. sources.md: Information about where to find the raw and 
validated results from the FCC's tests. 

COMMENTS:
To take out the comments from the sql submitted to bigquery, use
this sed command:
./<sql generating script> | sed -r 's/^[[:space:]]{0,}#.*$//'

ABOUT THE CAVEATS:
All the caveats of the analysis are derived from the FCC's analysis
done for their July 2012 report using April 2012 data. More 
information about this can be found here:
